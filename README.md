### My name is Sonny, I am a student currently studying at Goldsmiths University of London, working towards a Bsc in Electronic Music and Computer Technology. Having extensive experience in songwriting and performance, currently driving me is an urge to garner as much DSP wisdom as possible, having dug around for seemingly every DSP youtube tutorial available. In the coming years of my study, I wish to involve myself in as much online community as possible, widening my knowledge, collaberate/work with other programmers, and hopefully make some friends along the way :)
